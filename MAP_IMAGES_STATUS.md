## 🎯 Task Completed Successfully

All 14 map images have been successfully connected to their respective cards and detail pages in the Marvel Rivals Hub.

## 📊 What Was Done

### 1. Image Path Corrections

- All paths now correctly point to existing files in `public/images/maps/`

### 2. Files Updated
- ✅ `data/maps.json` - Updated all 14 image paths
- ✅ `IMAGE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Updated documentation with correct file extensions and status

### 3. Image Integration Points

- ✅ **Map Detail Pages** (`/maps/[slug]` pages) - Full-size images with overlays and badges
- ✅ **Next.js Image Optimization** - All images use Next.js Image component for performance
- ✅ **Responsive Design** - Images adapt to different screen sizes
- ✅ **Fallback Handling** - Placeholder icons show if images fail to load
