# Strategist Mastery: Complete Support Guide for Marvel Rivals

## Course Overview

Welcome to the comprehensive Strategist mastery course for Marvel Rivals! This guide will transform you from a basic healer into a game-changing support player who carries matches through superior decision-making, positioning, and utility usage. Whether you're playing Mantis, Luna Snow, Rocket Raccoon, or any other Strategist hero, the principles taught here will elevate your impact dramatically.

Many players underestimate the Strategist role, viewing it as simply "healing duty." In reality, elite Strategist players are the backbone of winning teams, making split-second decisions that determine the outcome of team fights. You're not just keeping teammates alive—you're enabling plays, denying enemy strategies, and often dealing significant damage yourself.

This course covers everything from fundamental healing prioritization to advanced positioning concepts, ultimate management, and the mental game of support play. By the end, you'll understand how to maximize your impact in every match and climb the competitive ladder.

## Chapter 1: The Strategist Mindset

### Redefining the Support Role

The first step to mastering Strategist play is understanding what the role truly entails. You're not a passive healer waiting for teammates to take damage—you're an active participant in every fight, making constant decisions that ripple through the entire match.

**The Core Principle**: Your job is to maximize your team's effective health and utility while minimizing the enemy team's effectiveness. This means healing, yes, but also damage boosting, crowd control, damage dealing, and strategic ability usage.

### Key Responsibilities

**Healing and Sustain**: Obviously your primary function, but with nuance. It's not about healing everyone to full health constantly—it's about keeping the right people alive at the right times.

**Utility and Crowd Control**: Many Strategists have powerful utility abilities. Mantis's sleep, Luna Snow's ice, Rocket's traps—these can win fights independently of healing.

**Damage Output**: Good Strategists heal. Great Strategists also deal damage. Every moment you're not healing should be spent dealing damage or using utility.

**Shot Calling and Communication**: As a Strategist, you have the best view of your team's health and positioning. Use this information to make calls about engagements, retreats, and ultimate usage.

### The Triage Mentality

Medical triage is the practice of prioritizing patients based on urgency and likelihood of survival. This same principle applies to Strategist play:

**Priority 1 - Critical Saves**: Teammates about to die who can still impact the fight. These are your emergency heals.

**Priority 2 - High-Value Targets**: Your other Strategist, your main tank, or a DPS with ultimate ready. Keep these players healthy.

**Priority 3 - Topped Off**: Players at full or near-full health. Don't waste resources here.

**Priority 4 - Lost Causes**: Sometimes a teammate is too far out of position or too low to save. Recognize when to let someone die rather than dying yourself trying to save them.

### Mental Framework for Success

**Stay Calm Under Pressure**: Strategists are primary targets. You'll be dove, flanked, and focused. Maintaining composure is essential.

**Think Three Steps Ahead**: Anticipate damage before it happens. Pre-heal teammates who are about to take damage rather than reacting after they're already low.

**Accept Imperfection**: You can't save everyone. Sometimes teammates will die despite your best efforts. Learn from it and move on.

**Communicate Constantly**: Call out flankers, low health teammates, ultimate status, and your own positioning. Your team needs this information.

## Chapter 2: Healing Prioritization and Resource Management

### The Healing Priority System

Not all healing is created equal. Understanding who to heal and when is the most impactful skill a Strategist can develop:

**Tier 1 - Other Strategists**: Your fellow support player is your highest priority. If they die, your team loses half its healing. Always keep your support partner healthy.

**Tier 2 - Main Tank**: Your Vanguard creates space and absorbs damage. Keeping them alive maintains your team's frontline presence. However, don't overheal a tank who's safely behind cover—spread your healing.

**Tier 3 - DPS with Ultimate**: A Duelist with ultimate ready can win the fight. Prioritize keeping them alive to use their ultimate.

**Tier 4 - DPS in Combat**: Active damage dealers who are currently fighting should be kept healthy to maintain pressure.

**Tier 5 - Out of Combat Players**: Teammates who are safe and not currently fighting are lowest priority. They can wait or find health packs.

### Dynamic Priority Adjustments

These priorities shift based on context:

**During Team Fights**: Focus on whoever is taking damage and can still impact the fight. Sometimes this means letting a flanker die to keep your core team alive.

**During Poke Phase**: Spread healing evenly to maintain everyone at high health before the fight starts.

**During Objective Contest**: Prioritize whoever is on the objective. A healed player contesting the point is worth more than a full-health player standing off it.

**During Ultimate Combos**: If your team is executing an ultimate combo, keep those players alive at all costs.

### Resource Management Fundamentals

Every Strategist has limited resources—cooldowns, ammo, or resource meters. Managing these effectively separates good players from great ones:

**Cooldown Tracking**: Know exactly when your abilities come off cooldown. Don't waste them on low-priority targets when you'll need them soon for high-priority ones.

**Ammo Management**: For Strategists with ammo-based healing (Rocket Raccoon), never let yourself run completely dry. Reload during safe moments, not during critical fights.

**Ultimate Charge**: Build ultimate charge efficiently by healing damage (not overhealing) and dealing damage to enemies. Every point of healing and damage contributes to your ultimate.

**Positioning for Resources**: Know where health packs are located. Sometimes directing a teammate to a health pack is better than using your cooldowns.

### Healing Efficiency Techniques

**Pre-Healing**: Heal teammates before they take damage when you know damage is incoming. This is more efficient than reactive healing.

**Burst Healing**: Save your highest healing output abilities for when teammates are critically low. Don't waste burst healing on minor damage.

**Healing Over Time**: Use HoT abilities on teammates who aren't in immediate danger. This is resource-efficient and allows you to focus on other tasks.

**Area Healing**: When multiple teammates are damaged, position yourself to heal multiple targets simultaneously with area-of-effect healing.

## Chapter 3: Positioning and Survival

### The Golden Rule of Strategist Positioning

**You can't heal if you're dead.** This simple truth should guide every positioning decision you make. Your survival is more important than any individual teammate's survival because your death impacts the entire team.

### Core Positioning Principles

**The Second Line**: You should generally be behind your tanks but ahead of or level with your DPS. This gives you line of sight to heal your frontline while maintaining distance from enemies.

**Cover Usage**: Always position near cover you can quickly retreat to. Never stand in the open, even when healing. Use corners, walls, and obstacles.

**Escape Routes**: Before positioning anywhere, identify at least two escape routes. If a flanker dives you, you need to know exactly where you're going.

**Line of Sight Management**: You need line of sight to heal, but you also need to break line of sight from enemies. Master the art of peeking to heal, then hiding to avoid damage.

### Map-Specific Positioning

**High Ground Advantage**: When possible, take high ground positions. This gives you better sightlines for healing and makes you harder to dive. However, ensure your team can still reach you if they need peel.

**Choke Point Defense**: Position behind your tanks at choke points, using the narrow space to your advantage. Enemies must push through your tanks to reach you.

**Payload Maps**: Stay near the payload for mobile cover, but don't stand directly on it unless necessary. You're too valuable to contest the objective yourself.

**Open Areas**: In open maps, stay near your team's core group. Isolation is death for Strategists.

### Dealing with Flankers and Divers

Flankers will target you constantly. Here's how to survive:

**Early Detection**: Listen for audio cues and watch for missing enemies. If you don't see their flanker, assume they're coming for you.

**Cooldown Management**: Save at least one defensive cooldown for flankers. Don't use all your abilities on healing if you know a dive is coming.

**Call for Peel**: Immediately call out flankers to your team. "Spider-Man on me" alerts your team to help.

**Fighting Back**: Don't just run—fight back while retreating. Many Strategists can duel flankers if they land their abilities.

**Positioning Near Peel**: Stay near teammates who can help you. A Strategist near their tank is much harder to kill than one isolated.

### Hero-Specific Positioning

**Mantis**: Stay at medium range where you can heal effectively but escape with your mobility. Use your sleep dart to peel for yourself.

**Luna Snow**: Position to maximize your area healing while staying safe. Your ice abilities provide self-peel.

**Rocket Raccoon**: Use your jetpack for vertical mobility. Position on high ground or near cover you can quickly reach.

**Adam Warlock**: Your resurrection ability means you can take slightly more risks, but don't rely on it. Position conservatively.

### Advanced Positioning Concepts

**Crossfire Positioning**: Position so enemies must choose between shooting you or your teammates. This splits their attention and reduces damage taken.

**Bait Positioning**: Occasionally, you can bait enemy cooldowns by showing yourself briefly, then retreating to safety. This wastes enemy resources.

**Rotation Timing**: Know when to rotate between positions. Staying in one spot too long makes you predictable and easy to flank.

## Chapter 4: Offensive Support and Damage Output

### The Damage-Healing Balance

Many Strategist players make the mistake of only healing. Elite players understand that dealing damage is also part of their job:

**Why Damage Matters**: Every point of damage you deal is damage your DPS doesn't have to deal. It builds your ultimate faster. It pressures enemies and forces them to use cooldowns or take cover.

**When to Deal Damage**: Any moment you're not actively healing should be spent dealing damage. If your team is at full health, shoot enemies. If you're waiting for cooldowns, shoot enemies. If you're building ultimate, shoot enemies.

**Target Priority for Damage**: Focus on low-health enemies your team is already shooting (securing kills), enemy Strategists (reducing their healing output), or enemies out of position.

### Offensive Ability Usage

Many Strategist abilities can be used offensively:

**Mantis Sleep Dart**: Use it on enemy DPS or Strategists to remove them from fights temporarily. A slept enemy is as good as a dead enemy for several seconds.

**Luna Snow Ice**: Freeze enemies to set up kills for your team or to peel for yourself.

**Rocket Raccoon Mines**: Place them on common flank routes or near objectives to damage and reveal enemies.

**Adam Warlock Damage Boost**: Use it on your highest-damage teammate during key moments to amplify your team's damage output.

### Securing Eliminations

Don't be afraid to secure kills:

**Low-Health Enemies**: If an enemy is one shot away from death, take the shot. A confirmed kill is worth more than letting them escape.

**Fleeing Enemies**: Chase down (safely) enemies trying to retreat. Denying them healing time is valuable.

**Ultimate Charge**: Elimination participation gives significant ultimate charge. Contribute to kills whenever possible.

### Damage Combos and Techniques

**Ability + Weapon Combos**: Many Strategists can combo their abilities with weapon fire for burst damage. Practice these combos.

**Headshot Practice**: Even as a Strategist, landing headshots matters. Spend time in practice mode improving your aim.

**Prediction Shots**: Learn to predict enemy movement and shoot where they're going, not where they are.

## Chapter 5: Ultimate Usage and Game-Changing Plays

### Understanding Strategist Ultimates

Strategist ultimates are often the most impactful abilities in the game. They can turn losing fights into wins, save teammates from certain death, or enable massive plays.

### Ultimate Building Strategies

**Efficient Charge Building**: Build ultimate through a combination of healing and damage. Don't just heal—actively deal damage to charge faster.

**Avoiding Waste**: Don't overheal teammates at full health. This generates no ultimate charge. Focus on healing actual damage taken.

**Damage Priority**: Shoot tanks for easy ultimate charge (they're large targets), but prioritize securing kills when possible.

### High-Impact Ultimate Usage

**Mantis (Healing Burst)**: Use it during team fights when multiple teammates are low. Don't waste it on minor poke damage.

**Luna Snow (Ice Storm)**: Excellent for zoning enemies off objectives or protecting your team during enemy ultimates. The area denial is incredibly powerful.

**Rocket Raccoon (Mech Suit)**: Use it to contest objectives, protect your team, or deal massive damage during team fights. The temporary tank form is incredibly versatile.

**Adam Warlock (Resurrection)**: Save it for critical moments when losing a teammate would lose the fight. Don't waste it on early picks.

### Ultimate Timing Principles

**Fight-Winning Ultimates**: Use your ultimate when it will win the current team fight. Don't save it for "the perfect moment" that never comes.

**Defensive Ultimates**: Sometimes the best ultimate usage is reactive—countering an enemy ultimate or saving a losing fight.

**Ultimate Economy**: Track both team's ultimates. If you have ultimate advantage, use yours to force out enemy ultimates. If you're at disadvantage, save yours to counter theirs.

**Overtime Ultimates**: In overtime or final pushes, use your ultimate liberally. A saved ultimate in a lost game is worthless.

### Ultimate Combos

Coordinate your ultimate with teammates:

**Mantis + Vanguard Ultimate**: Heal your tank during their ultimate so they can stay in the fight longer.

**Luna Snow + Area Ultimates**: Use your ice storm to zone enemies into your team's damage ultimates.

**Rocket + Team Push**: Use your mech form to lead a coordinated push with your team.

### Avoiding Ultimate Mistakes

Common ultimate errors to avoid:

- Using ultimate when your team can't capitalize on it
- Ulting into enemy defensive ultimates that negate yours
- Saving ultimate too long and never using it
- Using ultimate when the fight is already won or lost

## Chapter 6: Advanced Strategist Techniques

### Advanced Healing Techniques

**Predictive Healing**: Heal teammates before they take damage based on enemy positioning and ability cooldowns. This is more efficient than reactive healing.

**Healing Beam Management** (for beam-based healers): Constantly switch between targets to spread healing efficiently. Don't tunnel vision on one target.

**Animation Canceling**: Some Strategists can cancel healing animations to switch targets faster or use abilities more quickly.

**Healing Through Barriers**: Understand which healing abilities go through barriers and which don't. Use this knowledge to heal teammates behind cover.

### Advanced Positioning Techniques

**Off-Angle Support**: Sometimes the best support position isn't directly behind your team. Taking an off-angle can give you better sightlines and make you harder to dive.

**Vertical Mobility**: Use vertical space to your advantage. High ground positions are harder to reach and give better sightlines.

**Spawn Wave Coordination**: Time your deaths (when unavoidable) to respawn with teammates. A coordinated push is stronger than trickling in.

### Mind Games and Psychological Warfare

**Fake Vulnerability**: Occasionally bait enemy cooldowns by appearing vulnerable, then escaping or having your team punish the dive.

**Ultimate Bluffing**: Enemies play differently when they think you have ultimate. Use this even when you don't.

**Tilt Management**: Stay positive and keep team morale high. A tilted team performs worse, and as Strategist, you can influence team mental state.

### Communication Mastery

**Efficient Callouts**: Make clear, concise calls. "Flanker left" is better than "There's someone over there somewhere."

**Health Status Updates**: Call out when you're low or out of cooldowns so your team knows not to rely on you temporarily.

**Ultimate Tracking**: Track and call out enemy ultimates. "Their Magneto has ult" helps your team play around it.

**Positive Reinforcement**: Compliment good plays. Positive teams perform better.

### Matchup-Specific Strategies

**Against Dive Compositions**: Position more conservatively and save cooldowns for self-peel. Stay near teammates who can protect you.

**Against Poke Compositions**: Use cover aggressively and focus on keeping your team topped off. Poke damage is less threatening if you heal it quickly.

**Against Brawl Compositions**: Position to maximize area healing and focus on keeping your frontline healthy during sustained fights.

### Continuous Improvement

**VOD Review**: Record your games and analyze your deaths. Most deaths are preventable with better positioning or cooldown management.

**Pro Player Study**: Watch how top Strategist players position, prioritize healing, and use ultimates. Try to understand their decision-making.

**Mechanical Practice**: Spend time in practice mode improving your aim and ability accuracy. Even supports need good mechanics.

**Game Sense Development**: Play other roles occasionally to understand what they need from you. This improves your support play dramatically.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

Mastering the Strategist role in Marvel Rivals requires a unique combination of mechanical skill, game sense, decision-making, and mental fortitude. You're not just a healer—you're a playmaker, a shot-caller, and often the difference between winning and losing.

The concepts in this course provide a comprehensive foundation, but true mastery comes from applying these principles in real games and learning from every match. Every game presents unique challenges and opportunities to improve.

### Practice Checklist

- [ ] Play 10 games focusing solely on positioning and survival
- [ ] Track your deaths and identify the cause of each one
- [ ] Successfully peel for yourself against flankers 5 times
- [ ] Use your ultimate to win a team fight you were losing
- [ ] Review one of your VODs and identify 3 healing priority mistakes
- [ ] Deal damage while maintaining high healing output for an entire match

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Master One Strategist**: Focus on one hero until you're comfortable with all their mechanics
2. **Find a Duo Partner**: Strategist play is most effective with a coordinated tank or DPS partner
3. **Join Scrims**: Practice in organized team environments to develop coordination
4. **Study Pro Matches**: Watch competitive Marvel Rivals to see these concepts in action
5. **Engage with the Community**: Discuss strategies and get feedback from other Strategist players

### Final Thoughts

Remember that as a Strategist, you have the power to enable your entire team. A great Strategist can carry games just as effectively as a great DPS—just in different ways. Your impact might not always show up on the scoreboard, but it's felt in every team fight your team wins because you kept them alive and enabled their plays.

Stay calm, communicate clearly, position safely, and never stop learning. The path to Strategist mastery is challenging but incredibly rewarding.

Good luck, and may your healing be plentiful and your positioning be perfect!
