Duelists are the primary damage dealers and playmakers in Marvel Rivals. Your job is to secure eliminations, create pressure, and punish enemy mistakes. This isn't just about having good aim—it's about positioning, game sense, target selection, and knowing when to be aggressive versus patient.

## Chapter 1: Understanding the Duelist Role

### What Makes a Great Duelist Player?

The Duelist role in Marvel Rivals is fundamentally about **consistent damage output and securing eliminations**. Unlike Vanguards who create space or Strategists who provide utility, Duelists convert opportunities into kills and apply constant pressure to the enemy team.

### Core Responsibilities

**Securing Eliminations**: Your primary job is to get kills. Every elimination you secure is one less enemy threatening your team and one step closer to winning the fight.

**Applying Pressure**: Even when you're not getting kills, you should be dealing damage and forcing enemies to respect your presence. Pressure creates space and opportunities.

**Punishing Mistakes**: When enemies overextend, waste cooldowns, or position poorly, you must capitalize immediately. Great Duelists have a sixth sense for exploitable mistakes.

**Protecting Backline**: While not your primary role, you should help peel for your supports when they're being dove. A quick elimination of an enemy flanker can save your team.

### Duelist Archetypes

**Hitscan DPS** (Iron Man, Punisher): Instant damage at range. Excel at consistent pressure and punishing poor positioning.

**Projectile DPS** (Storm, Scarlet Witch): Require prediction but often have higher burst damage or area control.

**Flankers** (Spider-Man, Black Panther): Mobile heroes who attack from unexpected angles and target backlines.

**Hybrid DPS** (Hawkeye, Winter Soldier): Versatile heroes who can adapt their playstyle based on the situation.

### Mental Framework for Duelist Play

1. **Think in terms of value, not just kills**: A kill on their healer is worth more than two kills on their tank
2. **Track enemy cooldowns**: Knowing when enemies are vulnerable determines your engagement windows
3. **Communicate targets**: Call out low-health enemies and focus fire targets
4. **Accept that you'll die sometimes**: Aggressive plays sometimes fail, but playing scared guarantees mediocrity

## Chapter 2: Aim and Mechanical Skills

### Fundamentals of Aim

Aim is the foundation of Duelist play. Without solid mechanics, even perfect game sense won't translate to results.

**Crosshair Placement**: Always keep your crosshair at head level where enemies will appear. This minimizes the distance you need to flick when an enemy appears.

**Tracking vs. Flicking**: Tracking is smooth following of moving targets. Flicking is quick snaps to stationary or newly appeared targets. Master both.

**Sensitivity Settings**: Find a sensitivity that allows both precise tracking and quick 180-degree turns. Most pros use lower sensitivity for better precision.

**Mouse Acceleration**: Turn it off. Consistent muscle memory requires consistent mouse movement.

### Aim Training Routines

**Warm-Up Routine** (10-15 minutes before playing):
- 5 minutes tracking moving targets
- 5 minutes flick shots
- 5 minutes target switching

**Daily Practice** (if serious about improvement):
- 20 minutes in aim trainers (Aim Lab, Kovaak's)
- Focus on scenarios that match your main hero's weapon type
- Track your scores to measure improvement

### Hero-Specific Aim Techniques

**Hitscan Heroes**: Lead your target slightly to account for movement. Aim for the head but prioritize hitting shots over missing headshots.

**Projectile Heroes**: Learn projectile speed and arc. Predict where enemies will be, not where they are.

**Shotgun Heroes**: Track center mass for maximum pellet hits. Flick to finish low-health targets.

### Movement and Aim

**Strafing**: Move unpredictably while shooting. ADAD spam makes you harder to hit while maintaining accuracy.

**Jump Shooting**: Some heroes maintain accuracy while jumping. Use this to peek over cover or dodge shots.

**Ability Movement**: Many heroes have movement abilities. Practice shooting during and immediately after using them.

## Chapter 3: Flanking and Positioning

### The Art of Flanking

Flanking is attacking from an unexpected angle, forcing enemies to split their attention or turn their backs to your team.

**When to Flank**:
- When your team is engaging from the front
- When you have ultimate and need a better angle
- When enemies are distracted or grouped up
- When you have escape cooldowns available

**When NOT to Flank**:
- When your team needs you in the main fight
- When you don't have escape cooldowns
- When enemies have awareness of your position
- When the flank route is too long and you'll miss the fight

### Positioning Fundamentals

**The 40-60 Rule**: Spend 40% of your time in aggressive positions dealing damage, 60% in safe positions avoiding damage. Adjust based on your hero and situation.

**Cover Usage**: Always position near cover you can quickly retreat to. Peek, shoot, hide, repeat.

**High Ground Advantage**: High ground gives you better sightlines, makes you harder to hit, and provides escape routes. Contest it aggressively.

**Crossfire Positioning**: Position so enemies must choose between shooting you or your teammates. This splits their focus and increases your team's damage output.

### Map-Specific Positioning

**Payload Maps**: Position on high ground near the payload. Pressure enemies trying to contest while maintaining escape routes.

**Control Point Maps**: Take angles that cover multiple approach routes. Force enemies to expose themselves to reach the point.

**Choke Points**: Don't stand in chokes with your team. Take off-angles to create crossfire and punish enemies pushing through.

## Chapter 4: Target Priority and Focus Fire

### Target Selection Framework

Not all targets are equal. Killing the right target at the right time wins fights.

**Priority 1 - Out of Position Enemies**: Anyone isolated from their team is a free kill. Punish them immediately.

**Priority 2 - Enemy Supports**: Killing healers cripples the enemy team's sustain. They're usually squishy and high-value targets.

**Priority 3 - Low Health Enemies**: Secure kills on damaged enemies before they get healed. Confirmed kills are always valuable.

**Priority 4 - High-Threat DPS**: Enemy Duelists with ultimates or who are carrying their team should be focused.

**Priority 5 - Tanks**: Only focus tanks when no better targets are available or when your team is committing to killing them.

### Focus Fire Coordination

**Call Your Targets**: Use voice chat or pings to tell your team who you're shooting. "I'm on their Mantis" helps your team focus fire.

**Confirm Kills**: When an enemy is one-shot, call it out. "Mantis one" tells your team to finish the kill.

**Peel Calls**: If you're being dove, call for help. "Spider-Man on me" alerts your team to peel.

### Reading the Fight

**Count Cooldowns**: Track when enemies use important abilities. A Magneto without barrier is vulnerable.

**Watch for Ultimates**: Enemies with ultimate ready play differently. Respect their potential and position accordingly.

**Identify Win Conditions**: Sometimes you need to kill a specific target to win the fight. Identify and execute on that target.

## Chapter 5: Ultimate Usage and Impact Plays

### Ultimate Economy

**Building Ultimate Quickly**: Deal consistent damage to charge your ultimate fast. Don't waste time repositioning when you could be shooting.

**Ultimate Tracking**: Keep mental notes of enemy ultimates. Call out when key ultimates are used: "Their Iron Man no ult."

**Ultimate Combos**: Coordinate your ultimate with teammates. A Spider-Man ultimate into a Storm ultimate can wipe teams.

### High-Impact Ultimate Usage

**Spider-Man (Maximum Spider)**: Use it to dive backlines, secure key kills, or escape bad situations. The mobility and damage make it incredibly versatile.

**Iron Man (Invincible)**: Best used when you have high ground and clear sightlines. The sustained damage can wipe teams if they can't find cover.

**Storm (Omega Hurricane)**: Area denial and zoning tool. Use it to control objectives or punish grouped enemies.

**Scarlet Witch (Chaos Control)**: Massive burst damage. Use it on grouped enemies or to secure important kills.

### Ultimate Timing

**Proactive Ultimates**: Use your ultimate to start fights and create advantages. Don't always wait for the "perfect moment."

**Reactive Ultimates**: Some ultimates are best used to counter enemy plays or save losing fights.

**Economy Ultimates**: Sometimes using ultimate to secure one key kill (enemy carry, enemy support) is worth it even if it's not a "big play."

## Chapter 6: Carrying Games and Advanced Techniques

### The Carry Mindset

**Take Responsibility**: Don't blame teammates. Focus on what YOU can do better.

**Identify Win Conditions**: Every game has specific conditions for victory. Identify and execute on them.

**Adapt Your Playstyle**: If aggressive isn't working, play patient. If your team needs space, create it. Flexibility wins games.

### Advanced Mechanical Techniques

**Animation Canceling**: Many heroes can cancel ability animations with other actions. Learn these for faster combos.

**Ability Combos**: Practice hero-specific ability combinations for maximum burst damage.

**Movement Tech**: Advanced movement techniques like bunny hopping, air strafing, or ability jumps can give you edges.

### Game Sense Development

**Predict Enemy Positions**: Based on spawn timers and last known positions, predict where enemies are.

**Read Enemy Intentions**: Watch enemy positioning and cooldown usage to predict their next move.

**Macro Awareness**: Track ultimate economy, time remaining, and objective status to make informed decisions.

### Dealing with Counters

**Identify Your Counters**: Know which heroes counter yours and how to play around them.

**Positioning Against Counters**: Stay out of range or sightlines of heroes that counter you.

**Target Their Counters**: Sometimes the best way to deal with a counter is to kill them first.

**Hero Swapping**: Don't be stubborn. If you're being hard-countered and can't play around it, swap heroes.

### Continuous Improvement

**VOD Review**: Record your games and watch them back. Look for positioning mistakes, missed opportunities, and poor decisions.

**Pro Player Study**: Watch how top Duelist players position, aim, and make decisions.

**Aim Training**: Dedicate time to pure mechanical practice outside of matches.

**Mental Game**: Stay positive, learn from losses, and focus on improvement over wins.
