# Competitive Fundamentals: Ranked Climbing Guide

## Course Overview

This course covers the essential fundamentals every competitive Marvel Rivals player needs to know. Whether you're just starting ranked or stuck in a particular rank, these principles will help you climb consistently and become a better teammate.

## Chapter 1: Team Composition Basics

### The 2-2-2 Standard

Marvel Rivals uses a 2-2-2 role lock system: 2 Vanguards, 2 Duelists, 2 Strategists. Understanding how to build effective compositions within this framework is crucial.

**Core Composition Elements**:
- **Main Tank**: A Vanguard who leads engagements (Magneto, Hulk)
- **Off Tank**: A Vanguard who peels and creates space (Groot, Doctor Strange)
- **Main DPS**: Consistent damage dealer (Iron Man, Storm)
- **Flex DPS**: Adaptable damage or flanker (Spider-Man, Hawkeye)
- **Main Support**: Primary healer (Mantis, Luna Snow)
- **Flex Support**: Utility and secondary healing (Rocket Raccoon, Adam Warlock)

### Synergies and Counters

**Team-Up Synergies**: Some heroes have special team-up abilities. Build compositions that enable these powerful combinations.

**Counter-Picking**: If enemies have a dominant hero, consider swapping to counter them. Don't be stubborn about hero choice.

**Map-Specific Picks**: Some heroes excel on certain maps. Learn which heroes work best where.

## Chapter 2: Communication and Callouts

### Essential Callouts

**Enemy Positions**: "Spider-Man flanking left," "Magneto on point"

**Low Health Targets**: "Mantis one-shot," "Iron Man low"

**Ultimate Status**: "I have ult," "Their Hulk has ult"

**Cooldown Tracking**: "Magneto no barrier," "My heal on cooldown"

**Intentions**: "I'm engaging," "Falling back," "Group up"

### Communication Best Practices

- Keep callouts short and clear
- Use hero names, not "he" or "that guy"
- Stay positive and constructive
- Don't clutter comms with unnecessary chatter
- Call out your own mistakes to help team adapt

## Chapter 3: Ultimate Economy

### Understanding Ultimate Economy

Ultimate economy is the balance of ultimates between teams. Having more ultimates ready gives you a significant advantage.

**Tracking Ultimates**: Keep mental notes of which players (both teams) have ultimates ready.

**Ultimate Advantage**: When you have more ultimates, look to engage and use them.

**Ultimate Disadvantage**: When enemies have more ultimates, play defensively and try to bait them out.

**Ultimate Combos**: Coordinate multiple ultimates for maximum impact. A Magneto ultimate into Storm ultimate can wipe teams.

### Building Ultimate Efficiently

- Deal consistent damage
- Heal actual damage taken (not overhealing)
- Participate in eliminations
- Stay alive (you don't build ultimate while dead)

## Chapter 4: The Mental Game

### Staying Positive

**Tilt Management**: Recognize when you're tilted and take breaks. Playing while tilted guarantees losses.

**Positive Communication**: Encourage teammates and celebrate good plays. Positive teams perform better.

**Learning from Losses**: Every loss is an opportunity to improve. Focus on what you could have done better.

### Dealing with Toxicity

- Mute toxic players immediately
- Don't engage with flamers
- Report genuinely abusive behavior
- Focus on your own play

### Consistency Over Perfection

You don't need to carry every game. Consistent, solid play wins more than occasional hero plays followed by throws.

## Chapter 5: Ranked Climbing Strategies

### The 40-40-20 Rule

- 40% of games you'll win regardless of your performance
- 40% of games you'll lose regardless of your performance  
- 20% of games are decided by YOUR performance

Focus on maximizing your impact in that crucial 20%.

### Role Selection

**Play Your Best Role**: Climb fastest by playing what you're best at.

**Have Backup Roles**: Be competent in at least two roles for flexibility.

**Meta Awareness**: Know which heroes are strong in the current patch.

### Session Management

- Play when you're fresh and focused
- Take breaks after losses
- Stop playing after 2-3 losses in a row
- Review VODs between sessions

### Improvement Focus

- Pick one skill to improve each session
- Track your stats to measure progress
- Learn from better players
- Practice mechanics outside of ranked

## Conclusion

Climbing in Marvel Rivals requires mastering fundamentals, maintaining a positive mental game, and consistent improvement. Focus on these core principles and you'll see steady rank gains.

### Practice Checklist

- [ ] Play 10 games with focus on communication
- [ ] Track ultimate economy for an entire match
